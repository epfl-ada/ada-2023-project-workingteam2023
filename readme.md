# Title 
From Alien Invasions to Global Pandemics: Exploring the Evolution of Film Themes in Response to Societal Fears  

# Abstract 
# A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why? 
In this project, we will analyze the chronological evolution of movies’ themes in relation to the society’s fears. Fears have evolved significantly over the decades, shifting from the apprehension of war in the mid-20th century to concerns about emerging technologies during the industrial era, and more recently, to anxieties surrounding pandemics and climate change. By analyzing movies’ emerging themes in the plot, the evolution of movies’ genre as well as the movies with the biggest box office revenue, we can depict how the movie industry responded to the emergence and disappearance of major fears in the society. This analysis can be conducted on a global scale as well as on a regional scale, revealing geo-political nuances and historical particularities.  Our analysis will rely on various data sources that depict the societal fears experienced during the 20th and 21st centuries. (139 mots)  

# Research Questions: A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 
1. What are the primary domains of fear explored in the database's movies, and how do they evolve chronologically? 
2. Do movies addressing current societal fears tend to have higher IMDb ratings compared to those exploring other themes? 
3. How has the number of movies addressing major global fears evolved since the dataset's inception? 
4. Are emerging fears covered in movies related to historical, political or cultural events?
5. What is the geographical distribution of the different fears addressed in international movies? 
6. What patterns emerge in the portrayal of fears in movies, and are there recurring combinations of fears frequently depicted on screen?
7. What evolution of the society can we depict from all of the previous results?


# Proposed additional datasets (if any): List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible. 
1. Chapman University Survey of American Fears (CSAF) -> pas sûr encore 
This dataset contains an evaluation of American's top fears for years 2014-2023. This data enables us to have a general view on dominant fears in society.   

# Methods 
NLP  

# Proposed timeline 
1. Extract the general domains of fear in the global society from additional datasets 
2. Perform NLP on the plot to extract movies that treat those fears. Class them by fear domains. 3. Analyze the data from those movies (number of movies, box office revenue, release date) 
4. Draw plots depicting our results 
5. Create the website  

# Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone P3. 
Octavio and Faye were responsible for writing the README file.  
Clara, Romain and Colin were responsible for writing the Notebook. Clara focused on the general handling pipelines. Romain did some research on potential additional dataset and contributed to the data handling pipelines part. Colin did some research on NLP methods and contributed to the data handling pipelines part. 
We all did some personal research on the subject.  

# Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
