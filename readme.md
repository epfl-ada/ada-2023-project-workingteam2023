# Title
From Alien Invasions to Global Pandemics: Exploring the Evolution of Film Themes in Response to Societal Fears

# Abstract: 
# A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?
In this project, we will analyze the chronological evolution of movies’ themes in relation to the society’s fears. Fears have evolved significantly over the decades, shifting from the apprehension of war in the mid-20th century to concerns about emerging technologies during the industrial era, and more recently, to anxieties surrounding pandemics and natural disasters.
By analyzing movies’ emerging themes in the plot, the evolution of movies’ genre as well as the movies with the biggest box office revenue, we can depict how the movie industry responded to the emergence and disappearance of major fears in the society.
This analysis can be conducted on a global scale as well as on a regional scale, revealing geo-political nuances and historical particularities. 
Our analysis will rely on various data sources that depict the societal fears experienced during the 20th and 21st centuries.
